# Quizzical Solo Project

This is one of my first solo projects. It is part of the Free React Course by Bob Ziroll on Scrimba.com - https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact and the final solo project in that course. Figma file for the design was provide - https://www.figma.com/files/recent?fuid=1091566379350867747

This Free React Course by Bob Ziroll on Scrimba.com is very well structured and taught. I would recommend it to anyone who
wants to learn Reat.

I have just added my twist to this i.e. made it a sports quiz as I am a very avid sports fan.

I would also welcome any and all reviews of my code.

Thanks.
